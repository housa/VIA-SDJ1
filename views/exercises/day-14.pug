    h2 Exercise 14.01
    p Modify your MyDate class so that you:
    ul
      li Add an equals method that will return true if the object given as argument has the same values for day, month and year. The method signature should be: public boolean equals(MyDate obj)
      li Add a copy method, public MyDate copy(), that will return a new MyDate object with the same date (day, month and year)
      li Add a copy constructor, public MyDate(MyDate obj), that sets the fields to the same values as those in the MyDate object given as argument
    p Then write a test class to test the new constructor and methods.
    h2 Exercise 14.02
    p.
      Add a new method nextDays(int days) to your MyDate class. The method is similar to the nextDay() method you have
      made previously, but instead of only increasing the date by one day, it should increase the date by the number of
      days given as argument.
    h2 Exercise 14.03
    p.
      Add a static method named today() to your MyDate class. The method should return a MyDate object that is always
      set to the current date.
    p.
      To find out what date it is today you can use Javaâ€™s built-in GregorianCalendar class. So, first import that
      class:
    p import java.util.GregorianCalendar;
    p.
      Then you can get the current day, month, and year like this:
    ul
      li GregorianCalendar currentDate = new GregorianCalendar();
      li int currentDay = currentDate.get(GregorianCalendar.DATE);
      li int currentMonth = currentDate.get(GregorianCalendar.MONTH)+1;
      li int currentYear = currentDate.get(GregorianCalendar.YEAR);
    p.
      When you are finished, then also modify the no-argument constructor in the MyDate class, so it always sets the
      date to the current date.
    h2 Exercise 14.04
    p.
      Add yet another method isBefore(MyDate date2) to your MyDate class. The method should return true if the date is
      before date2 that is given as argument, and if not then the method should return false.
    h2 Exercise 14.05
    p Implement the following UML class diagram
    div.uml-class
      div.name Car
      div.fields
        ul
          li.private make : String
          li.private model : String
          li.private colour : String
          li.private licenceNumber : String
          li.private year : int
      div.methods
        ul
          li.public Car(make : String, model : String, colour : String, licenceNumber : String, year : int)
          li.public Car(make : String, model : String, colour : String, year : int)
          li.public getMake() : String
          li.public getModel() : String
          li.public getColour() : String
          li.public getLicenceNumber() : String
          li.public getYear() : int
          li.public setColour(colour : String) : void
          li.public setLicenceNumber(licenceNumber : String) : void
          li.public copy() : Car
          li.public toString() : String
          li.public equals(car : Car) : boolean
    p.
      The 4 argument constructor should set the licenceNumber to some value indicating that the car
      has no licence number.
    p.
      copy should return a reference to a Car-object with the same values for
      the 5 instance variables.
    p.
      equals should return true if the object passed as argument is a car with the
      same values of all 5 instance variables.
    h2 Exercise 14.06
    p.
      Take a look at the test from monday, and see if you can implement everything so it works as it should. The test
      can be found on the frontpage.
