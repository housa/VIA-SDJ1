    h2 Exercise 18.01
    p.
      Write an application that creates an integer array using an initialization list, to initialize it to some values
      of your choice. Then use a loop to double the value of each element. Finally use another loop to print out all the
      elements.
    p.
      Example: if the array contains {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} the program changes the values to {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and prints them
      out.
    h2 Exercise 18.02
    p.
      Write an application that creates an integer array (sourceArray) using an initialization list, to initialize it to
      some values of your choice. Then create a new array (destinationArray) and in a loop copy all elements from
      sourceArray to destinationArray. Then use a loop to print out the (hopefully identical) contents of the two
      arrays.
    h2 Exercise 18.03
    p.
      Write an application that creates an integer array (sourceArray) using an initialization list, to initialize it to
      some values of your choice. Then create a new array (destinationArray) with a size of twice the length as
      sourceArray and in a loop copy all elements from sourceArray to the first half of destinationArray. The remaining
      elements in destinationArray should be 0.
    p.
      Example: sourceArray: {2, 3, 4, 5} so destinationArray should be: {2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0}.
    h2 Exercise 18.04
    p.
      Write a program that reads 5 integers from keyboard and stores them in an array. Then use a loop to calculate the
      average value of the integers, and after the loop print out the result.
    h2 Exercise 18.05
    p.
      Write a program that:
    ul
      li Reads 4 integers from keyboard and stores them into an array (array1).
      li Reads 4 more integers from keyboard and stores them into another array (array2).
      li.
        Uses a loop to check if the two arrays are identical, i.e. all elements at the same
        position in the two arrays must be the same.
    p Example1: array1={1, 2, 3, 4} and array2{1, 2, 4, 5} are NOT identical.
    p Example2: array1={10, 20, 30, 40} and array2{10, 20, 30, 40} are identical.
    h2 Exercise 18.06
    p.
      Write a program that:
    ul
      li Reads 4 integers from keyboard and stores them into an array (array1).
      li Reads 4 more integers from keyboard and stores them into another array (array2).
      li Creates a new array with the same length (sumArray).
      li Uses a loop to store the sum of each element pair in the two arrays in sumArray.
    p Example1: array1={1, 2, 3, 4} and array2{1, 2, 4, 5} makes sumArray={2, 4, 7, 9}
    h2 Exercise 18.07
    p.
      In a 9-hole Golf tournament a player had the following number of hits 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3. Create a class
      with a main method in which you:
    ul
      li.
        Create an int array initialized to contain the 9 values shown above
      li.
        Use a loop to calculate the total number of hits for the 9 holes and the number of
        Hole-in-One’s, i.e. the number of elements being equal to 1. (The loop should not rely on 9 as being the length
        of the array, but made more general so that it could be changed later on)
      li After running the loop print out the following:
        ul
          li The total number of hits
          li The average hits per hole (the average value of the 9 elements)
          li The number of Hole-in-One’s
    h2 Exercise 18.08
    p.
      Write an application that creates 3 different arrays using initialization lists, to initialize it to some values
      of your choice. One should hold booleans, one should hold Strings, and the last should hold objects of type Person.
    p.
      Use loops to print out all information in the different arrays.
